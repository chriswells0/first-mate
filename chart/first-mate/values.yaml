  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious

  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.

# Recommended, but requires cluster-level privileges:
# To monitor multiple namespaces using a single instance of this chart,
# define the ignored and/or monitored namespaces as shown below:
namespaces:
  ignored:
    - kube-node-lease
    - kube-public
    - kube-system
    - kubernetes-dashboard
  # Specify a list of monitored namespaces to restrict the scope of monitoring.
  # An empty/omitted list means "all namespaces that aren't in the ignored list."
  # If a namespace is in both lists, it will be ignored.
  # monitored: []
# To use per-namespace instances of this chart, set namespaces to a "falsey" value
# (e.g., null or an empty value). This prevents the ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding
# from being created, and only the chart's namespace will be monitored for updates.
# namespaces: null
